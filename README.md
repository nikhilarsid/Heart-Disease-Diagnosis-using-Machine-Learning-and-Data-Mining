## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of my MSc dissertation project: **"Heart Disease Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Data Mining."** The goal is to develop predictive models that accurately diagnose heart disease from patient clinical data, helping to enhance early detection and healthcare outcomes.

The project tackles challenges such as imbalanced data and feature relevance to build robust, interpretable machine learning models that can assist clinicians in decision-making.

## üéØ Objectives

* Cleanse, normalize, and select the most impactful features from clinical datasets.
* Build and compare multiple supervised classification models:

  * Random Forest
  * Decision Tree
  * Naive Bayes
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Evaluate model performance using comprehensive metrics:
  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC.
* Identify key clinical features driving heart disease prediction.
* Develop a simple **Tkinter-based GUI** to enable easy, interactive patient risk prediction.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset is a combined collection sourced from [IEEEDataport](https://ieee-dataport.org/) incorporating records from:

* Cleveland Clinic Foundation
* Hungarian Institute of Cardiology
* University Hospital, Zurich
* V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach
* Statlog (Heart) Dataset

---

## üîç Features

The dataset contains 11 clinical features, including:

* Age
* Sex
* Chest Pain Type
* Resting Blood Pressure
* Cholesterol
* Fasting Blood Sugar
* Resting ECG Results
* Maximum Heart Rate
* Exercise-Induced Angina
* Oldpeak (ST Depression)
* ST Slope

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values
* Normalize and scale features
* Select relevant features using statistical tests and model-based rankings

### Model Development

* Train Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers

### Model Evaluation

* Assess performance with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC curves

### Feature Importance

* Analyze and aggregate feature importance across models to identify critical predictors
